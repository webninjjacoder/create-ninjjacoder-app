## Contributing a Starter App

For engineers developing new starter apps based on our production applications, we've streamlined the process:

1. Run the following script to generate a new starter app:

```bash
npm run gen:new
```

This script will prompt you to select a production app as your starting point. Your generated app will be placed in a wip (Work in Progress) folder. For example, if you choose react-cra as your base and name it login, the directory structure will be wip/react-cra-login.

By following these steps, you can efficiently create starter apps tailored to your project requirements.

If you have questions or need assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out. We're here to help you kickstart your projects and develop new starter apps effectively. Happy coding! 🙌🚀
